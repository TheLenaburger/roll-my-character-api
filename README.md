## Planning Story

Initially I set out to create an application that will allow people to easily create level 1 characters for D&D. I wanted people to be able to roll their stats randomly, or assign them with the standard stat array, and to see bits of information regarding what stats meant, and some of the differences between races and classes. It's not meant to be a replacement for pen&paper or the paid, fully loaded sites like D&D Beyond; just a fun little site for rolling up level 1 characters!

### User Stories

- As a user I want to sign in/up
- As a user I want to Create a new Character
- As a user I want to see all of my Characters
- As a user I want to view a single Character
- As a user I want to Update a Character I own
- As a user I want to Delete a Character I own

### Technologies Used

- jQuery
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript

### Unsolved Problems

- Still need to Add in Stats/stat rolling functionality
- Would like to eventually add in a secondary database with information on the races and their stat modifiers
- Honestly, I need to find a friend who does web design because design is just not my forte
